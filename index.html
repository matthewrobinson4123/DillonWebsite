                            <h2>About Me</h2>   
                            <p>Hello! My name is Dillon Robinson and welcome to my portfolio website. 
                                I am a Canadian sound designer with a passion for audio. 
                                My love of films and video games shaped my love for sound design and my desire to create new media for the next generation to enjoy.
                                I obtained my Master's of Science in sound design from the University of Edinburgh.
                                My work has also been featured in a number of award winning films and video games.
                                While establishing my sound effects company, Crying Giant, I have
                                become heavily focused in video game sound design. It is my dream to
                                work on AAA games like the ones that I love and to one day work at
                                Skywalker Ranch which has been home to many sound design legends.
                                If you are as passionate about film and video games as I am, let's make
                                some noise and give our generation an escape from reality for an hour
                                or two.
