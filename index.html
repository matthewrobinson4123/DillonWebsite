                        <h2>About Me</h2>   
                        <p>Hello! My name is Dillon Robinson and welcome to my portfolio website. 
                            I am a Canadian sound designer with a passion for audio. 
                            My love of films and video games shaped my love for sound design and my desire to create new media for the next generation to enjoy.
                            I obtained my Master's of Science in sound design from the University of Edinburgh.
                            My work has also been featured in a number of award winning films and video games.
                            While establishing my sound effects company, Crying Giant, I have
                            become heavily focused in video game sound design. It is my dream to
                            work on AAA games like the ones that I love and to one day work at
                            Skywalker Ranch which has been home to many sound design legends.
                            If you are as passionate about film and video games as I am, let's make
                            some noise and give our generation an escape from reality for an hour
                            or two.
